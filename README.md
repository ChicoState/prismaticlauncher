# Prismatic Launcher

Prismatic Launcher is planned as a cross-platform native desktop manager for Stardew Valley mods. The repository currently contains development infrastructure only; product UI, game discovery, mod installation, SQLite data access, and release packaging have not been implemented.

## Repository map

- `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json` — C++20 build and CTest harness configuration.
- `vcpkg.json`, `vcpkg-configuration.json` — Qt dependency manifest and immutable vcpkg baseline.
- `scripts/` — Linux CI, quality, and infrastructure-smoke scripts.
- `tests/infrastructure/` — reserved for infrastructure-only probes; product tests are not present.
- `Dockerfile.ci` — non-root Ubuntu Linux build/test image; it is not a production image.
- `.github/workflows/` — pull-request validation and guarded release workflow definitions.
- `infrastructure_plan.md` — approved infrastructure decisions.
- `.agents/skills/` — repository-specific agent skills.
- `src/` — not created yet; future product source belongs here.
- `packaging/` — not created yet; future product-owned portable-archive packaging belongs here.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install host prerequisites

Install the following on every development workstation:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a supported stable release.
2. [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.28 or newer.
3. [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and a C++20-capable native compiler: MSVC Build Tools on Windows, Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, or GCC/Clang on Linux.
4. [Qt 6.8 LTS](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) for native UI development.
5. [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), bootstrapped locally. The repository pins its dependency registry baseline in `vcpkg-configuration.json`.
6. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine if you will run the repeatable Linux validation environment.

Native release maintainers also need their platform packaging tools. macOS distribution requires an Apple Developer account, signing certificate, and notarization credentials. Windows signing requires a code-signing certificate if the project elects to sign Windows archives.

### 2. Configure the native toolchain

Set `VCPKG_ROOT` to your local vcpkg checkout, then configure and build the currently empty application harness:

```bash
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev --output-on-failure
```

No `.env` file or local service is needed: the planned app is self-contained and will use local SQLite. Do not add secrets, certificates, or game data to the repository.

### 3. Validate infrastructure in Docker

Build and run the Linux validation image:

```bash
docker build --pull=false -f Dockerfile.ci -t prismaticlauncher-ci:local .
docker run --rm prismaticlauncher-ci:local
docker run --rm --entrypoint bash prismaticlauncher-ci:local -lc ./scripts/verify-infrastructure.sh
```

The image is disposable and exposes no ports or volumes. Remove the local image when no longer needed with `docker image rm prismaticlauncher-ci:local`.

### 4. Quality checks

```bash
./scripts/format-check.sh
./scripts/static-analysis.sh
./scripts/verify-infrastructure.sh
```

Until C++ product source and Qt Test targets exist, formatting and static-analysis scripts report that their work is deferred, and CTest verifies the configured harness only. Linux coverage generation starts automatically once product tests generate coverage data; the planned policy is a 60% line-coverage floor for tested core targets.

## CI and releases

Pull requests run Linux Docker validation, infrastructure checks, formatting, static-analysis configuration, Gitleaks, and CodeQL. Windows and macOS runners configure and build the CMake harness; product targets will extend those validations.

Tags matching `v*` start the guarded GitHub Release workflow. It intentionally fails before publishing until product-owned `packaging/` scripts exist and the protected `release` environment contains the required Apple notarization configuration. Future releases will publish portable archives: Windows ZIP, macOS ZIP, and Linux `tar.gz`, along with SHA-256 checksums.

Required GitHub configuration: create a protected `release` environment; configure `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` for macOS signing/notarization. If Windows signing is adopted, also configure `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_CERTIFICATE` and `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PASSWORD` and update the product packaging implementation.

## Troubleshooting

- **`cmake --preset dev` cannot find Ninja:** install Ninja and ensure it is on `PATH`, or use a future platform-specific preset.
- **Docker cannot connect to the daemon:** start Docker Desktop or the Docker Engine service, then rerun the two Docker commands above.
- **Qt is not found after product targets are added:** install Qt 6.8 LTS and configure CMake with the appropriate `Qt6_DIR`, or use the vcpkg toolchain chosen by the product implementation.
- **A release workflow stops at prerequisites:** this is expected until `packaging/` and the protected release environment are deliberately configured; it does not publish partial releases.
